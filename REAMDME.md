# Apple Health Data 

This repository contains code to extract fields from Apple's XML health data and showcases metrics in a dashboard.  

## Problem Statement 

The Health app in iOS allows the users to access all the health related data collected from other apps and devices. Although there are features to analyze data and identify trends in the app, Apple does not provide an alternative method to view on desktops or bigger screens. The goal of the project is to extract data from Health app, build a dashboard in PowerBI so that I can find some insights about my health and be better informed.

## Data 

I exported the data from the Apple's Health app which when extracted is a XML file with 350K lines at 105 MB. The dataset is not uploaded owing to privacy concerns and large size.
